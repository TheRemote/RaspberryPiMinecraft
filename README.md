<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>
To get started / install the server type:<br>
<pre>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheRemote/RaspberryPiMinecraft/master/SetupMinecraft.sh | bash</pre><br>

<h2>Getting Help</h2>
To get help you may open an issue here or visit my web site at https://jamesachambers.com/raspberry-pi-minecraft-server-script-with-startup-service/ which contains lots of comments from myself and users helping each other out!

<h2>Changing Minecraft Server Versions</h2>
If a new version of Minecraft is out and the script hasn't been updated yet you can change it in the SetupMinecraft.sh script.  If you use the command nano SetupMinecraft.sh it will be the first line in the file like this:<br>
<br>
Version="1.18.1"<br>
AllowLocalCopy="1"<br>
<br>
Make sure to change AllowLocalCopy="1" to tell the script you want to actually run the local copy instead of the latest version.<br>
Note that for this to work the Paper Minecraft server must also have released the latest version or the download will fail.  You can check here: <a href="https://papermc.io/downloads">https://papermc.io/downloads</a><br>

<h2>Tested Distributions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi OS - Bullseye/Buster/Stretch</li>
<li>Ubuntu / Ubuntu Server 22.04 / 21.10 / 20.04 (LTS)</li>
<li>Debian 11 Bullseye / Debian 10 Buster / Debian 9 Stretch</li>
<li>Arch Linux</li>
<li>TinkerOS Stretch</li>
</ul>

<h2>Troubleshooting Note - Oracle Virtual Machines</h2>
A very common problem people have with the Oracle Virtual Machine tutorials out there that typically show you how to use a free VM is that the VM is much more difficult to configure than just about any other product / offering out there.<br>
The symptom you will have is that nobody will be able to connect.<br>
It is because there are several steps you need to take to open the ports on the Oracle VM.  You need to both:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Set the ingress ports (TCP/UDP) in the Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) security list</li>
  <li>*and* set the ingress ports in a Network Security Group assigned to your instance</li>
</ul><br>
Both of these settings are typically required before you will be able to connect to your VM instance.  This is purely configuration related and has nothing to do with the script or the Minecraft server itself.<br><br>
I do not recommend this platform due to the configuration difficulty but the people who have gone through the pain of configuring an Oracle VM have had good experiences with it after that point.  Just keep in mind it's going to be a rough ride through the configuration for most people.<br><br>

<h2>Troubleshooting Note - Hyper-V</h2>
There is a weird bug in Hyper-V that breaks UDP connections on the Minecraft server.  The fix for this is that you have to use a Generation 1 VM with the Legacy LAN network driver.<br>

</ul>

<h3>April 6th 2022</h3>
<ul>

<li>Create "logs" folder for new servers to avoid harmless error messages (cleanup)</li>
<li>Add new "jre" folder to backup command's ignore list to avoid bloated backups</li>
</ul>

<h3>March 23rd 2022</h3>
<ul>
<li>Removed snapd installation as the snapd repository will only install OpenJDK 18 or higher which won't work with Paper</li>
<li>Paper still does not support OpenJDK 18 and will give errors using a version that high</li>
<li>Working on a new more reliable method to install OpenJDK 17</li>
</ul>

<h3>March 23rd 2022</h3>

</ul>
Update_Sudoers
<h3>November 30th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update to 1.18 -- make sure you have backups first if you are upgrading from an existing server!</li>
</ul>

<h3>September 15th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update to allow OpenJDK 17 which is now the default "snap"</li>
</ul>

<h3>September 2nd 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update to Paper Minecraft Server API v2</li>
</ul>

<h3>August 1st 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a missing -A parameter for a curl command (thanks davie2000, <a href="https://github.com/TheRemote/RaspberryPiMinecraft/issues/27">issue #27</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 27th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added PATH variable to scripts to improve compatibility on some distros</li>
<li>Server now fixes permissions upon startup</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 21st 2021</h3>

<li>Added error redirection to crontab line to help diagnose failures during scheduled restarts</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 19th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where SetupMinecraft.sh could throw an error if no Java version was installed</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 17th 2021</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed server name prompt</li>
    <li>Added username missing to fix service issue</li>
    <li>Reduced memory recommendation by 100MB to allow more space for the OS / other processes since newer versions of Minecraft are requiring more memory.  Remember, if you don't leave enough memory for other things the Minecraft server will crash for memory issues, but it's because you set it too high (counterintuitive I know) and didn't leave enough for the OS and it killed your Minecraft server to prevent the entire OS from crashing.</li>
    <li>Added in check to ensure start.sh and other scripts are not being ran as root.  If this happens you have to use sudo screen -r to find the screen and the permissions will be wrong since root isn't the owner of the server files</li>
    <li>If you know you ran the script/server as root (which starts creating files owned by root instead of the regular user) and your server won't start/is wonky run the fixpermissions script from your server folder with ./fixpermissions.sh and it will correct them for you!</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 15th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added safety check for path to server -- please use the default path of ~ if you aren't familiar with fully qualified Linux paths/directories -- you really don't want to change the safe defaults unless you have a really specific need.</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 14th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a issue that was causing backups to not rotate (it should only keep 10).  Thanks Olli</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 8th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update to 1.17.1</li>
<li>Update documentation to explain new AllowLocalCopy="1" flag.  This flag tells the script not to run the latest online version and to run the local copy.  You want to use this if you are changing the version or making any modifications to the script itself before running it.</li>
<li>Added update.sh convenience script that calls the latest version of SetupMinecraft.sh</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where having an OpenJDK greater than 16 was not triggering the snap configuration (usually only seen on the cutting edge Ubuntu flavors)</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 5th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with SetupMinecraft.sh saving scripts to the home folder instead of the minecraft folder (thanks Ryan A J.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 3rd 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add option to choose a custom directory instead of forcing the home path</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 24th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Removed installation of OpenJDK above OpenJDK 16 as the Paper Minecraft server is not working with versions higher than 16</li>
<li>If you have a higher version of Java installed use the following command: sudo update-alternatives –config java and select OpenJDK 16</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 19th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>1.17 Release</li>
<li>Make sure you have backups and take copies of your backups and place them outside the Minecraft folder to be 100% safe</li>
<li>Once running the new version you can't go back to the old one without restoring a backup because it writes new stuff in your server the old version doesn't understand and crashes on</li>
<li>As long as you have backups you should be okay!</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 16th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Raised minimum OpenJDK requirement to 16 in preparation for the 1.17 Paper Minecraft server release</li>
<li>If a new enough OpenJDK is not available in apt (Raspberry Pi OS is on OpenJDK 11 for example) it will be installed via snapd</li>
<li>If snapd is not installed it will ask you if you want to install it (reboot required) or abort</li>
<li>After the reboot run SetupMinecraft.sh again and it will finish installing OpenJDK 16!  Be patient, it can take some time, even 10-15 minutes on a good connection and longer on a bad one</li>
<li>Sorry for the inconvenience, there isn't an easier way to get it until the Raspberry Pi OS apt repositories are updated!</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 12th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed syntax error (thanks aruthir!)</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 10th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added OpenJDK 17 and 18 placeholders for prerequisite installations</li>
<li>Added a fallback to the non-headless JRE for platforms that don't offer that metapackage</li>
<li>Paper Minecraft 1.17 is not yet available but should be soon.  If you go to https://api.papermc.io/v1/paper/ and see 1.17 in the list it's available and you can change the version variable at the very top of SetupMinecraft.sh otherwise it hasn't been released yet.  Should be soon!</li>
</ul>

<h3>March 22nd 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lowered amount of recommended memory by a flat 200MB due to so many people having "Out of Memory" errors</li>
<li>Note:  Nobody has ever really been "out of memory" on the Pi since like the Pi 1.  The problem is you're using TOO MUCH.</li>
<li>If you're getting memory related crashes you need to turn your memory DOWN.  The server will recommend lower amounts going forward.</li>
</ul>

<h3>March 16th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added backup rotation - server keeps the last 10 backups by default</li>
<li>If you want to change the amount of backups held it is located in the "start.sh" script with a comment of '# Rotate backups -- keep most recent 10'</li>
<li>This adds a little responsibility for saving really old backups but fixes the issue I and many others have had of the server getting filled with backups and crashing</li>
</ul>

<h3>January 31st 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update to 1.16.5</li>
<li>Server now takes ownership of server files on each start to prevent folks a whole heap of trouble and heartache when restoring backups/moving files/etc.</li>
<li>Added check to make sure script isn't being ran as sudo to prevent installing to the /root folder</li>
</ul>

<h3>December 5th 2020</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update to 1.16.4</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where if your username on the Pi was Minecraft it would cause the script to break (thanks Minecraftschurli, <a href="https://github.com/TheRemote/RaspberryPiMinecraft/pull/20">pull request #20</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause OpenJDK 10 to try to be installed even if OpenJDK 11 installation was successful</li>

</ul>

<h3>December 28th 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>Backup system now takes a backup of your entire server folder (minus logs and cache) instead of just the world folders.  This mean it now backs up things like server.properties and other worlds if you are running a multiverse setup.</li>
</ul>

<h3>December 20th 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updated to version 1.15.1</li>
<li>Added more information to script installation warnings to help with initial configuration</li>
<li>Added warning to 2700MB limit on 32 bit operating systems explaining that you can lift the 3 GB limit by using a 64 bit Pi distribution</li>

<li>Fixed issue where when reconfiguring an existing server you would not be prompted to configure daily reboots</li>
<li>Removed /boot/config.txt tweaks as they are no longer compatible with Pi 4</li>
</ul>

<h3>August 24th 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>To prevent startup failure on 32bit ARM the maximum memory for the Minecraft server is capped at 2700MB. This is a per process limitation of 32 bit on ARM and Linux. This restriction can be lifted by using a 64 bit operating system.</li>
</ul>

<li>Current stable version of the Paper Minecraft server is 1.13.2</li>
<li>If you want to install 1.14.2 you may select to do so during installation</li>
<li>Be aware that 1.14.2 continues to have severe performance issues for the entire Minecraft server/hosting community.  After playing on it myself and talking to the Paper developers I can personally state that performance on 1.14.2 is really bad right now and highly recommend sticking with the stable version.</li>
</ul>

<h3>May 31st 2019</h3>
